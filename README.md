### About the Project
___

15% of public school students across the country receive special education services. Legally, a teacher is expected to provide the accommodations that are outlined for each special education students. These kinds of accommodations can range from something like a check in 4 times per class period, or being assigned a peer buddy for extra support. Managing a classroom with multiple students' accommodations, all of which occur at difference cadences can feel nearly impossible. SuccessAbility is a full stack application to support teachers in managing the accommodations their students need, and documenting each time they provide an accommodation to a specific student.
